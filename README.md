## Description

A game where random labyrinths are generated on each face of a cube, each of them connected by doors on their sides.

The objective of the game is to collect all keys in each face, while avoiding the pursuers, to unlock a final door and escape. Each face has a different colour to identify it.

Pursuers move according to their distance to the player. The closest one while chase the player while the rest of them will just randomly move around the corridors.

Labyrinths are made using Primm's algorithm. Two and three dimensional arrays are used to construct the final cube.
